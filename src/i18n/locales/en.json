        "question": "What is IV vitamin therapy?",
        "answer": "IV vitamin therapy is a medical treatment that delivers vitamins, minerals, and nutrients directly into your bloodstream through an intravenous drip. This method bypasses the digestive system, allowing for 100% absorption and immediate benefits. It's used to boost energy, enhance immunity, improve hydration, and support overall wellness."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is IV vitamin therapy safe?",
        "answer": "Yes, IV vitamin therapy is very safe when administered by licensed medical professionals. At Premier Health, all treatments are performed by certified physicians and nurses following strict medical protocols. We conduct thorough health assessments before each treatment to ensure safety and effectiveness."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does a treatment take?",
        "answer": "Most IV vitamin drip sessions take between 30-60 minutes, depending on the specific treatment you choose. During this time, you can relax in our comfortable treatment rooms, read, work on your laptop, or simply rest while the nutrients are delivered."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should I get IV vitamin therapy?",
        "answer": "The frequency depends on your individual health goals and needs. Some clients benefit from weekly sessions, while others prefer monthly treatments. Our medical team will create a personalized treatment plan during your consultation to achieve your specific wellness objectives."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I expect during my first visit?",
        "answer": "Your first visit begins with a consultation where our medical team reviews your health history and discusses your wellness goals. We'll then recommend the most appropriate treatment for you. The IV drip is administered in a comfortable treatment room, and most clients feel relaxed and energized during and after the session."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any side effects?",
        "answer": "IV vitamin therapy is generally very well tolerated. Some clients may experience minor side effects such as coolness at the injection site or a mineral taste during the infusion. Serious side effects are extremely rare. Our medical team monitors you throughout the treatment to ensure your comfort and safety."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I eat before my treatment?",
        "answer": "Yes, we recommend eating a light meal before your IV vitamin therapy session. Being well-hydrated and having eaten recently can help you feel more comfortable during the treatment. Avoid heavy meals immediately before your appointment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you accept insurance?",
        "answer": "IV vitamin therapy is typically considered an elective wellness treatment and is not covered by most insurance plans. We offer competitive pricing and various payment options including cash, credit cards, and popular payment plans like valU, Tabby, and Tamara."
